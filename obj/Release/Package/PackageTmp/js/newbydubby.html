        ⦁	<p>Perfect Numbers: In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. The first perfect number is 6 – its positive divisors (excluding itself) are 1, 2, and 3, whose sum is 6. </p>

    ⦁<p>	Write a function to display all perfect numbers between 1 and 10,000. </p>
    ⦁<p>	Write a program to display the first 5 Happy Numbers. Happy numbers are those that can be reduced to 1 through the following process – Start with any positive integer, replace the number with the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat until the result is 1 or the result is an endless loop. </p>
